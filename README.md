# Something New: AIs and Us

A book by David Orban exploring artificial intelligence, technological singularity, and humanity's future.

## 📖 About the Book

Technological Singularity is the hypothetical moment in time when self-modifying artificial intelligences arrive. Setting their own goals and methods to reach them, they'll change the face of the planet and the course of history.

This book exposes in an accessible way the consequences of exponential technological acceleration and how artificial intelligences could transform the rules that guide our knowledge of the world.
