        <p>Are you one of us?
     The purpose of this book is not to make predictions about what will be the year in which artificial intelligences will present themselves to be reckoned with. In fact, wether happens within twenty years, as many experts expect, or in two hundred, the effort itself to predict what this event may involve and the possible steps to prepare ourselves represent a great value for humanity.
     So, if you arrived to read up to this point, at the end of the book, my hope is that you have acquired an active attitude, looking to the future with open eyes, counting on our collective ability to realize it.
     It is essential to spread the knowledge among non-specialists about the challenges that artificial intelligences place on us. Being one of us means speaking, writing, and debating to lay a solid foundation for the next phase of our global civilization.</p>
